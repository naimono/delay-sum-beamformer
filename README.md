# DelaySum
This is a repository for an audio plugin that simulates delay sum beamformer. The delays are computed using interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) calculations. The two calculations are used because ITD performs well on lower frequencies, whereas ILD performs better on higher frequencies. The repository is dependent on IPlug2 framework and its dependencies.
